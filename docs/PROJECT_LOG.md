# Project Log

Use this file to capture decisions, open questions, and next steps so we can resume smoothly across sessions.

## Summary
- Multi-agent PyGame swarm environment with stigmergy.
- PettingZoo Parallel API for dict-based multi-agent interactions.
- Discrete 9-action joystick interface.
- DQN training with independent or shared policies.
- Optional SB3/RLlib DQN training backends.
- Demo and screenshot tooling included.
 - RLlib backend uses compatibility shims and may require setting `RAY_TMPDIR` if `/tmp` is full.

## Change Log
- Added a repo rule: when Codex updates files, it must log a short summary in `docs/PROJECT_LOG.md` (added to `AGENTS.md`).
- Summary of recent work: converted `SwarmEnv` to PettingZoo Parallel API, updated training/demo scripts to dict-based I/O, added SB3/RLlib backends with dispatcher, expanded dependencies in `requirements.txt`, updated docs, and added RLlib compatibility shims; checkpoints saved for RLlib in `checkpoints/rllib_dqn/`.
- Fixed RLlib demo loading by normalizing the checkpoint path to a `file://` URI in `train/demo.py`.
- Patched RLlib demo to coerce replay buffer type to a string during `Algorithm.from_checkpoint`.
- Registered the `swarm_pz` env in RLlib demo before loading checkpoints.
- Disabled strict RLlib DQN config validation during demo checkpoint load to avoid replay buffer type errors.
- Added `--max-steps` to `train/demo.py` so demos can auto-exit for smoke tests.
- Added `--ray-tmpdir` flag to RLlib training and demo to avoid `/tmp` pressure and socket path length issues.
- Added `.ray_tmp/` to `.gitignore`.
- Added `docs/ONBOARDING.md` with a code-first RL walkthrough for future developers.
- Expanded `docs/ONBOARDING.md` with the DQN trainer mapping (theory → code and key blocks).
- Added `docs/QandA.md` to capture common questions and answers.
- Added an `AGENTS.md` rule to log system/codebase questions into `docs/QandA.md`.
- Added an Environment MDP diagram to `docs/UML.md`.
- Logged a Q&A about `_handle_targets` rewards and sim-to-real implications.
- Logged a Q&A clarifying that target radius checks imply environment target knowledge in sim.
- Added `docs/ToDo.md` with a sim-to-real required-change checklist.
- Logged Q&A about what it means for the env to be PettingZoo-native.
- Logged Q&A defining MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron).
- Added inline comments to `train/independent_dqn_pytorch.py` and expanded the DQN walkthrough in `docs/ONBOARDING.md`.
- Logged Q&A about SB3/RLlib training vs underlying DL libraries.
- Logged Q&A about PettingZoo vs SB3/RLlib vs PyTorch roles.
- Logged Q&A explaining that a Q-function is not itself a policy.
- Logged Q&A clarifying that `batch_size`/`lr` are optimizer settings while `epsilon_*` is exploration.
- Expanded `docs/ToDo.md` with sim-to-real training checks and logged the related Q&A.
- Added line-by-line annotations to `train/independent_dqn_pytorch.py` and noted this in `docs/ONBOARDING.md`.
- Logged Q&A defining what "PettingZoo Parallel" means.
- Added `docs/RESOURCES.md` with official links (PettingZoo/Gymnasium), GitHub repos, and learning resources.
- Added Stanford CS234 YouTube playlist to `docs/RESOURCES.md`.
- Logged beginner learning path Q&A in `docs/QandA.md`.
- Logged a Q&A summarizing how to learn the repo by following the environment, custom DQN trainer, backend dispatcher, and demo flow.
- Logged a beginner-oriented Q&A mapping core RL concepts directly onto the main environment and DQN trainer files.
- Logged a Q&A describing a minimal-change Raspberry Pi + Arduino sim-to-real architecture with a Pi-side real-world adapter and Arduino low-level control layer.

## Key Commands
- Random rollout: `python train/random_rollout.py`
- Train (headless): `python train/independent_dqn_pytorch.py --headless --total-steps 10000 --save-dir checkpoints --save-every 2000`
- Demo: `python train/demo.py --checkpoint-dir checkpoints`
- Screenshot gallery: `python train/capture_screenshots.py`

## Decisions
- Default training uses independent Q-networks unless `--shared-policy` is passed.
- Pheromone grid uses simple deposit + decay + diffusion.

## Open Questions
- Do we want a nest/return task and food-carrying state?
- Should pheromone deposit depend on carrying food?
- Add video capture or logging dashboards?

## Next Steps
- Add carry state + nest reward (optional)
- Add two pheromone channels (food vs nest)
- Improve training stability or add PPO alternative
